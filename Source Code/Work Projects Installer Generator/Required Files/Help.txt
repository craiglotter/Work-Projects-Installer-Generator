All CodeUnit work projects use Advanced Installer 1.9 to build their installer files. Work Projects Installer Generator is a simple application that scans through all the work project folders in a specified base folder, searching for existing .aip installer files and then running an existing copy of Advanced Installer (on the system) in order to call a command line build operation. The generated files are then copied across into the project's main release folder.

To select the Projects folder to check, either click on the browse button or drag and drop the folder straight on to the text box. Note that a Projects base folder follows the form of "Base Project Folder" -> "Example App - 04 November 2004" -> "Source Code" -> "Example App - 04 November 2004" -> "Required Files"

To select the Advanced Installer executable to use, either click on the browse button or drag and drop the executable file straight on to the text box.

To start the operation, simply click on the Begin button. 

The help and about menu options brings up the help and about dialog boxes respectively.
